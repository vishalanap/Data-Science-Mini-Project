## House Price Prediction

<hr>

#### Problem Statement:
The project aims to analyze various factors of houses corresponding to their price via generating and comparing the accuracy of used models to predict the house prices using the following three ML algorithms:
1. Multiple linear regression
2. Decision tree
3. Random forest regression

<br>Housing price is strongly correlated to other factors such as location, area, population, as it requires information apart from HPI to predict individual housing prices.

<hr>

#### Objectives:
1. To understand and study the correlation between variables and house price.
2. To visualize the given data to provide an insight for future decisions.
3. To recognize the most suitable models or algorithms required for prediction.
4. Use machine learning algorithms to train the model.
5. To compare the accuracy of models.
6. To develop an efficient and accurate system for house price prediction.

#### Dataset used:
1. King Countyâ€™s dataset is used from Kaggle  published under CC0
2. Contains house sale prices for King County, which includes sales between May 2014 and May 2015
3. The dataset consisted of 21 variables and 21613 observations
